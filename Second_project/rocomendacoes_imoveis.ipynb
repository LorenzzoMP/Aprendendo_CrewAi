      "Considering the client's income details and financing criteria, I would recommend exploring the following viable financing options:\n",
      "1. Traditional Mortgage: With a stable income and good credit score, the client could opt for a traditional mortgage with a reasonable down payment. This option provides long-term financing with fixed or adjustable interest rates.\n",
      "2. FHA Loan: If the client has a lower credit score or limited down payment, an FHA loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration could be a suitable choice. It offers competitive interest rates and requires a lower down payment.\n",
      "3. VA Loan: If the client is a veteran or active-duty service member, a VA loan could be a great option with no down payment requirement and favorable terms.\n",
      "4. Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM): For clients who plan to stay in the property for a shorter period, an ARM could offer lower initial interest rates before adjusting in the future.\n",
